Active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by The Economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia 
in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). The Economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five 
or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors 
within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by "sharp" 
comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014.
