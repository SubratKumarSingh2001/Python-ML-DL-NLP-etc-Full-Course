Active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by The Economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia 
in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). The Economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five 
or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors 
within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by "sharp" 
comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014.
The trend analysis published in The Economist presents Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) as successful in retaining 
their active editors on a renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately 42,000.[26]
The English Wikipedia has the Arbitration Committee (also known as ArbCom) that consists of a panel of editors that imposes binding rulings 
with regard to disputes between other editors of the online encyclopedia.[27] It was created by Jimmy Wales on 4 December 2003 as an 
extension of the decision-making power he had formerly held as owner of the site.[28][29] When it was founded, the committee consisted 
of 12 arbitrators divided into three groups of four members each.[28][30] In 2022, for English Wikipedia, Americans accounted for about 
40% of active editors, followed by British and Indian editors accounting for about 10% of each, and Canadian and Australian at about 5%
A notable discussion within the English Wikipedia community concerns the preference for national variety of the English language, 
particularly American English and British English.[33] Various suggestions have been made, ranging from standardizing a single form of 
English to creating separate versions of the English Wikipedia project.[citation needed] According to a style guideline, "the English 
Wikipedia has no general preference for a major national variety of the language" and "an article on a topic that has strong ties to a 
particular English-speaking nation uses the appropriate variety of English for that nation. A 2013 study from Oxford University found that 
the most disputed articles on the English Wikipedia tend to address broader, global issues. In contrast, articles on other language Wikipedias 
often focus on regional issues. This pattern is attributed to the status of English as a global lingua franca, leading to contributions from many 
editors for whom English is a second language. The study identified the most disputed entries on the English Wikipedia as George W. Bush, anarchism,
